# UnixDaemon Google Forms
A collection of Google App Scripts to create Google forms and documents.

I've extracted these out and placed them under version control so they
can be edited and reused without using the Forms web UI. The tooling
around this is currently incredibly basic, copy and paste all the way!,
but the code is the important part and so is worth extracting.

## Alert Feedback Form

The [Alert Feedback Form](/alert-feedback-form/) provides a set of three
questions to determine if the alert actually requires human intervention
and how useful it is.
